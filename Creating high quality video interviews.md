#Creating high quality video interviews with a quick & cheap setup

As a part of my job I’ve been recording interviews at conferences and other social events with investors, corporates and startups. These events are often abroad and I need to be able to travel light. 

**I’ve had good results with the following affordable combination of equipment:** 

- [Canon 70D](http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/slrs/canon_eos70d) (any xxD or xxxD of the 1080p video models actually)
- [50mm prime lens](http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-50mm-f-1.8-STM-Lens.aspx) (the new Canon nifty-fifty - great value for money)
- [Røde Reporter Microphone](http://www.rode.com/microphones/reporter) (high quality omnidirectional mic)
- [Zoom H4n Recorder](https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/zoom-h4n-handy-recorder) 
- [Manfrotto Tripod](http://www.manfrotto.com/) (less will do, as long as it’s stable)
- 5m XLR cable


###Setup
Attach the camera to the tripod and position it with a nice background. The nifty-fifty from Canon opens up to F1.8 (sharpest from F2.8 and down though) and can blur the background quite a lot. Focus on the interviewee and that part is ready. Attach the microphone to the Zoom Recorder with the XLR cable and choose the right input. Now you have two separate systems, one for video, one for audio. Press record on both camera and Zoom Recorder, clap your hands or snap your fingers (sync point for editing) and start the interview.   

###Shooting
While shooting monitor the sound coming from the microphone through the Zoom Recorder via headphones plugged into the Zoom. The Reporter mic is omnidirectional and can just be held between the interviewer and interviewee without pointing it to the person speaking.
If you've set up for a narrow [DoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field) (low aperture value) on the camera, continuously check that your interviewee is in focus.   

###Pre-Editing
Sort video and audio to avoid transferring clips that are useless when it comes to further work.
Before dumping everything into your editing software check the quality of your sound clips. If you're not satisfied load all sound from the Zoom Recorder into [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/) and do some noise reduction if the environment has been loud. When recording with the Reporter mic and a Zoom you only record on one channel (mono), so be sure to split the mono track onto both stereo tracks. This can easily be done in Audacity too.   

###Editing
Import video and audio into your favourite editing software and prepare a new project. By keeping the original soundtrack from the camera temporarily and putting the high quality sound from the Zoom Recorder next to it, it's rather easy to sync them. Be sure to get this right though - there's nothing worse than watching an interview where the sound is ahead or behind. After they are synced, get rid of the original soundtrack. 
The rest of the editing is all about color corrections, background music, titles, logos, transitions etc. 

Any questions, don't hesitate.
